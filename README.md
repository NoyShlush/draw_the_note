# Draw the note

I often faced cases where I was needed to write a note, but I didnâ€™t have a pen or paper near me.
So I decided to develop an application that will allow me to create and save quick notes and trigger an alert at the selected time. The note can be made by drawing on the screen with my finger. Also, I wanted to be able to choose the type, color and thickness of the brush that I will want to work with.

* Using listeners in at least two different techniqes
* Dialogs box

* Working with an adapter
* Long-term data retention by using SQLite
* Broadcast receiver
* Service
